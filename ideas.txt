Classes:
Python: Classes are weird. Attributes how you would normally define them are constant.
You need to add the class as a formal parameter. You can Dynamically Add Attributes within
methods. Private variables are declared with __[insert name].

Java: Everything must be in a class and primiative data types are discouraged 
(this will be more for data types).

C++: Access specifiers are specified in as public: [variables] or private: [variables].
