Scoping
Python: Static
Java: Static
C++: Static

-----

Garbage collection
Python: Implict
Java: Implict
C++: Explict

-----

Classes:
Python: Classes are weird. Attributes how you would normally define them are constant.
You need to add the class as a formal parameter. You can Dynamically Add Attributes within
methods. Private variables are declared with __[insert name].

Java: Everything must be in a class and primiative data types are discouraged 
(this will be more for data types).

C++: Access specifiers are specified in as public: [variables] or private: [variables].

-----

Function parameters:
Python: Can have default assigned Function parameters. *args allows variable length arguments.

C++: Defualt assigned function parameters. 

Java: No default assigned function parameters. []args allows variable length arguments.

-----

Typing system:
Python: Anything can be anything, types can be changed without complaint.
Can not have variables without an assigned value.

C++: Very strong typing. Must be declared and can have variables with unassigned values.
Will give a warning

Java: Similar to C++.


-----

Exceptions
Python: Uses try and catch system.

C++: Similar to Python.

Java: Similar to Python.
-----
Abstraction

Python: Classes only

Java: Classes only

C++: Structs and classes
-----

Data types:
Python: 
- Primitive data types: Integer, Float, Boolean, String

Java:
- Primitive data types: Similar to C however encourages you to use Classes instead.

C++:
- Primitive data types: Many
