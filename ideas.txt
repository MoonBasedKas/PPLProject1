How the langauge is ran.
Python in interrpeted: https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-interpreted
Java is hybrid: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/jjdev/Oracle-JVM-JIT.html#GUID-23D5BA60-A2B3-45F9-93DF-81A3D971CA50
C++ is compiled: https://en.cppreference.com/w/

Scoping:
Python: Static

Java: Static

C++: Static

-----

Garbage collection:

Python: Implict
Java: Implict
C++: Explict

-----

Classes:
Python: Classes are weird. Attributes how you would normally define them are constant.
You need to add the class as a formal parameter. You can Dynamically Add Attributes within
methods. Private variables are declared with __[insert name]. Classes are optional. 
Multiple inheritance, super() will automatically add all variables to class. Can work with each 
class seperately.

Java: Everything must be in a class and primiative data types are discouraged 
(this will be more for data types). REQUIRES user to write classes.
Interfaces.

C++: Access specifiers are specified in as public: [variables] or private: [variables].
Classes are optional.
Multiple inheritance.
-----

Function parameters:
Python: Can have default assigned Function parameters. *args allows variable length arguments.
Functions are first class data types.
Every parameter is effectively a generic.

C++: Defualt assigned function parameters. First class kinda. Pass by reference and value.
Templates

Java: No default assigned function parameters. []args allows variable length arguments.
First class with static. Avoids pass by reference sticks to by value. First class also kinda
using lambdas. Generics.

-----

Typing system:
Python: Anything can be anything, types can be changed without complaint, Type casting.
Can not have variables without an assigned value.
Many types but weak type checking. Type hints.

C++: Very strong typing. Must be declared and can have variables with unassigned values.
Will give a warning.

Java: Similar to C++.


-----

Exception handling:
Python: Uses try and catch system.

C++: Similar to Python.

Java: Similar to Python.

-----

Abstraction:
Python: Classes only

Java: Classes only

C++: Structs and classes

-----

Data types:
Python: 
- Primitive data types: Integer, Float, Boolean, String

Java:
- Primitive data types: Similar to C however encourages you to use Classes instead.

C++:
- Primitive data types: Many

https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html

Control Flow:
Python: if, for, while, break, continue, pass, match (switch), functions
For loop will iterate through a list and each value x will be equal to 
a value in the list.

match: similar to case statement

Java: if, for, while, do-while, continue, pass, switch.
do-while do at least once.

C++: if, switch, while, do-while, for, goto, pass, continue.

Goto: disrupts the flow of the program and unconditially transfers control

-----

Dependency:

Python: Platform indepdent. Due to being interpreted instead of compiled.

Java: Platform indepdent. Due to java byte code. As long as the JVM can be ran 
it can run on your platform.

C++: Machine depedent

-----

Pointers:
Python and Java do not have pointers.

C++ uses pointers.
