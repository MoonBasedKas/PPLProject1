\section*{Abstract}
Python, C++, and Java are all popular languages each with their own advantages. We will observe how each 
language compares with each other. Determining what we gain from each implementation and if a certain implementation is 
better.\\

\section*{CCS Concepts}
\textbullet\hspace*{0.5mm} \textbf{Software and its engineering} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Language Features}; Syntax; \textit{Semantics}.\\
\section*{Keywords}
Syntax, Semantics, Language Features.\\
\section{Introduction}
Python, C++, and Java all have their own unique advantage. That might make one prefer over the others.
In this we will attempt to determine the best features that each language has and compare it to others.
Each language has a different goal in mind. For example Python strives to be readable and beginner-friendly compared to C++
which wants to give the user power.\\

\section{Classes}

All the languages we are analyzing provide classes and are an important feature when designing a high level language. However, Python implements classes with unique
syntax and Semantics. Attributes not defined in classes are static private variables are declared with a double underscore $(\_\_x)$, and local
attributes must be declared in methods. Finally, constants do not exist. Being able to declare new attributes in a method is a very powerful feature.
The problem is that while powerful it hurts readability and is a weird choice for python as a language. When attributes could be defined anywhere it makes attributes hard to find.\\

In C++ and Java the classes are implemented similarly when considering attributes. All attributes are declared outside of methods. You state if the attribute is public, private, or static.
In python attributes and methods are public by default meanwhile Java and C++ attributes are Private by default. Private by default attributes is great. Enforcing abstraction on the user and
increasing the security of their classes as the user is forced to decide what can be accessed from the outside. Python declaring private is more readable but is held back by most attributes
most likely being declared within methods.\\


\section{Functions}

\section{Control Flow}


\section{Data Types}

%  Could combine that with Classes and functions.

\section{Garbage Collection}

While a lot of factors can be broken down into sections there are some factors existing outside these sections. These 
factors are still worth considering. One instance is garbage collection if we want implicit or explicit. While implicit
garbage collection is great and helps secure the language. This could save users a lot of time and make debugging easier 
but if you are looking for efficiency by removing the overhead of garbage collection explicit would be better.\\

Python and Java both have implicit garbage collection meanwhile C++ has explicit. Explicit garbage collection relies on 
the user to properly manage their memory usage. Users are very likely to not properly manage their memory and will 
force the user to spend more time debugging. While the efficiency is great it is not worth the security we lose.\\
